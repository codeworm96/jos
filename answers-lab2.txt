boot_alloc() is a function used to allocate space when setting up the
memory system. It uses current nextfree as result, and then it will move
the nextfree backward with n bytes and round up it to make the nextfree
is kept aligned to a multiple of PGSIZE. If the nextfree goes beyond the
upper bound of the available memory, the function will panic. (Only 4MB
memory is available when using the entry page table)

The array of Page structures should be created with boot_alloc() in the
mem_init() function. Then the kernel use page_init() to initialize the
page free list. In base memory, only pages at
[PGSIZE, npages_basemen * PGSIZE) are free. In the extended memory, we can
use boot_alloc(0) to get the begining of the free space.

In page_alloc(), we first check if there is any page in the free list.
If so, the first page in the list will be allocated. If the ALLOC_ZERO
flag is set, the page will be filled with 0.

page_free() will insert the given page into the page free list at the
head.
